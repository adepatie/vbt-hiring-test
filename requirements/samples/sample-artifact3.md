Project Name: Retail Performance Console (RPC)

Background:
Our regional managers currently rely on weekly consolidated Excel reports that cause delays in decision-making. We want a lightweight system that centralizes store performance metrics, highlights anomalies, and reduces manual data aggregation.

Objectives:
1. Provide near real-time visibility into store KPIs.
2. Enable early detection of performance issues.
3. Consolidate POS and scheduling data into one view.
4. Build a foundation for Phase 2: forecasting + deeper analytics.

Constraints:
- Must be browser-based.
- MVP should handle 150 stores across 10 regions.
- Authentication via our existing SSO provider.
- Reporting frequency limited by vendor APIs (15-minute updates).
