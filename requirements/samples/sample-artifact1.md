Client: We need a way for regional managers to track store-level performance without waiting for weekly reports. Right now everything is buried in spreadsheets.

Consultant: So you’re looking for a centralized dashboard?

Client: Exactly. But not just viewing numbers — we want alerting when KPIs fall below thresholds. And ideally some automated insights, even if simple at first.

Consultant: Any integrations required?

Client: Two to start — our sales POS (CloudRetailPro) and our scheduling tool (RosterPro). Longer term we want HR data, but not for Phase 1.

Consultant: And timeline?

Client: Prototype in 6 weeks, production-ready by end of quarter if possible.
