# Testing Plan (Bootstrap)

Automated tests will be added once key server actions exist. For now:

1. **Smoke checks**
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run dev` to ensure the dashboard renders.

2. **Upcoming required tests (per spec)**
   - Stage transition validation.
   - WBS aggregation and validation helpers.
   - Agreement versioning + proposal application service.

As each feature lands, document how to run its tests here along with any data setup instructions.
